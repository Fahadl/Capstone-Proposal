## Project Title:
- Emotion Detection.

## Group Members:

- Third Member

## Objectives:
- To develop a system that can accurately detect emotions from both voice and facial expressions.
  - Develop deep leanring models to classify emotions from voice and facial expressions.
  - Evaluate the performance of the models on a held-out test set.
  - Deploy the models in a production environment.

## Dataset Description:
- The RAVDESS dataset consists of speech audio files produced as part of research on speech emotion recognition. The dataset includes 24 actors (12 male, 12 female), and       each actor recorded eight emotions (neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, and surprised) in two intensities (normal and strong). The total number of audio      files in the dataset is 1,440.

## The expected (Machine learning / Deep Learning) Algorithms:

- We train and evaluate the CLSTM model for speech emotion recognition and the pre-trained neural network for face emotion recognition. We achieve an accuracy of XX% on the    test set for speech emotion recognition and an accuracy of YY% on the test set for face emotion recognition. 
- Overall, our project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning-based approaches for emotion recognition from speech and facial expressions. Our models can be     
  deployed in real-world applications, such as sentiment analysis in customer service and emotion-based recommendation systems.

## Final Deliverables:
